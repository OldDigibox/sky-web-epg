#     Web EPG | Current Version: **`5.12`**
A recreation of the classic EPG on the Sky Digiboxes and legacy Sky+ from 2005-2010. While we are only planning on basing this from the 
latest Sky+ EPG version `5.08.6` (some elements will be reused from `3.8.8`), we have plans to make the 1998 and 2001 Digibox EPG menus too.
